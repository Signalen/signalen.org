## Roadmap Signalen July 2021 - December 2021
The product steering group has been busy working with all community members of Signalen to determine which functional improvements they would like to see within Signalen.

The second half year we have decided to focus our efforts on making Signalen more user-friendly for the people who handle the notifications. Below is a summary of the features we will be working on:

---

| Priority | Feature theme (epic) | Description | Complexity/ Scope of work |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Granularity of read and write permissions | Adjust dropdown to read-only users -> small (depends on 1) | medium / large |
| 2a | Filtering | Refactor | large |
| 2b | Filtering | Autocomplete add address | small |
| 3a | More user-friendly management | Routing rules in Django admin | small |
| 3b | More user-friendly management | Machine learning, research needed | large |
| 3c | More user-friendly management | Additional questions implementer in front-end| large |
| 4 | Enrich data dump | Enrich data dump| small/medium |
| 4 | Notify practitioners| Send mail / Make configurable | medium |

More detailed information can be found on our [project board on Github](https://github.com/orgs/Signalen/projects/2) with user stories labeled as “Roadmap 2021”.

At the moment the product steering group is busy looking together with other community members how this functionality can be funded and implemented.
