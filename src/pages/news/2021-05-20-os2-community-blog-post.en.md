# Blog post on OS2 featured Signalen

Recently a blog post on [collaboration in practice](https://os2.eu/blog/blog-samarbete-i-praktiken) was published by Jan Ainali from Foundation for Public Code on the OS2 blog.
OS2 is Danish network about specifying, developing, and governing of digital solutions made by public bodies and for public bodies â€“ in collaboration with private vendors, without vendor-lock in.
The blog post talks about some essentials for good collaboration and uses examples from the Signalen community to illustrate how it can be done in practice.
