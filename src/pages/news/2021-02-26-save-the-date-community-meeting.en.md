# Signalen Community meetup

Signalen is the open source initiative of Dutch municipalities to receive and manage notifications and nuisance reports. Now, Signalen is also being reused at other municipalities.

## Municipalities

The second Signalen community meetup is all about welcoming new Signalen replicators. If you are a municipality interested in learning more about Signalen or are considering using it, check out [here](https://eventyay.com/e/12fbd0dc) the program details and sign up for our Signalen community meetup!

## Market parties

Do you believe in a healthy business model with Open Source at its core? Do you have ideas on how we can work together as a market and government to create a sustainable ecosystem around Signals? Then sign up [here](https://eventyay.com/e/12fbd0dc) for our Signalen community meetup!
