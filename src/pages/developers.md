# Signalen for developers and vendors

The Signalen teams plan to start work on making Signalen open and reusable in spring 2020. Signalen is changing every day, but in the meantime we invite you to explore our code, have a tinker and give us feedback.

You can learn more about our work or contribute to Signalen at:

* [Amsterdam's Signalen Github repo](https://github.com/amsterdam/signals)
* [Signalen API spec](https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/api/swagger/?url=/signals/swagger/openapi.yaml) and [API documentation](https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/signals/)

Join our community at:

* [Signalen channel on the Common Ground Slack](https://samenorganiseren.slack.com/archives/CQB3TNZGB)
* [Signalen page on Common Ground](https://commonground.nl/groups/view/54477168/signalen)

## Vendors

We will need vendors that can help municipalities of all sizes get Signalen up and running, and keep it running, in a cost effective way.

We've already had interest from many VNG (Vereniging van Nederlandse Gemeenten, representing 355 municipalities) members, as well as Ghent (Belgium).

If your company wants to contribute to or join the Signalen project, email us at <signalen@publiccode.net>.
