# Signalen for civil servants

We're improving Signalen so that municipalities everywhere can benefit.

Signalen's advantages include:

* automatic report classification (increasing efficiency because no humans need to be involved)
* realtime overview of reports, status and history
* easy integration with other systems through standard APIs (including for external contractors and subcontractors)
* rich data and analysis opportunities to improve processes

## Operating Signalen

Signalen is unlike any other control center software currently on the market.

### Reliability

Amsterdam's Signalen implementation has a high uptime. We believe an even higher percentage is possible. We're currently extending Signalen to make it easier to maintain and troubleshoot.

### Easy maintenance and support

We're building Signalen to be open source from the start. This allows a flourishing vendor ecology to develop, so that cities have real choice in their procurement and implementation.

### Legal framework

Signalen was built from the start to comply with these laws:

* EU [General Data Protection Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj) (GDPR)
* The Dutch [Archiefwet 1995](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0007376/2020-01-01)

### Standards compliance and APIs

Signalen is built around common standards and APIs to make it easy to exchange data with other systems.

Signalen already complies with:

* [Common Ground standards](https://commonground.nl/cms/view/54476259/wat-is-common-ground/54476519)
* CROW (standard main categories and subcategories for machine learning data model classification)

Signalen is easily connected to existing nuisance complaint systems (like [Verbeterdebuurt](https://www.verbeterdebuurt.nl/) and [BuitenBeter](https://www.buitenbeter.nl/).

It already has APIs for connection to common municipal contractors' systems (like [Sigmax](https://www.sigmax.nl/)).
