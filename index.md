# Signalen

Signalen makes it easier for residents to make a nuisance report, and helps the city respond to the most important things first.

Signalen includes:

* algorithmic processing by type of complaint and second layer triaging and prioritisation by humans
* automatic updates to complainants about the status of their report
* automatic alerts to city staff based on analysis of combined reports
* easy passing on of reports to other city workers and subcontractors

## The Signalen team

To make Signalen fully reusable outside of Amsterdam, [VNG Realisatie](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/) is working together with Den Bosch, Almere and Amsterdam, and supported by the [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net/). The team will start work in spring 2020.

Our goals for 2020 are to:

* make the code reusable for other municipalities
* get the code into production at another municipality
