# Signalen website

A website to get potential new users of Signalen to get to know it and get them started.

This site is a collaborative project by the Signalen community and is meant to be [easy to contribute to](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Building, testing and deploying

This site is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). First make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. Then install the dependencies with the `npm install` command. After this you can use the `npm start` to start a local web server and build/update the site.

The `master` branch of this repository is automatically deployed using Netlify.

## How to add a news article to the website
You can add a news article to the website by adding a Markdown document to the `pages/news/` folder. The news section of the website has multilingual support. Copy an existing file and edit it. Use the following filename convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md`

Make sure the document includes the following frontmatter:

```
---
path: "/news/2021-02-11-filename/"
date: "2021-02-11"
title: "Welkom op het Signalen nieuws"
lang: nl
template: default
```

Make sure you set the `path` and `lang` parameters. The lang is used to filter out the specific posts for a particular language.
If you want to provide an English version of your news article make sure you prefix the path with `en` and your filename includes a language local using the following convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-filename.en.md`

Example:

```
---
path: "/en/news/2021-02-11-filename/"
date: "2021-02-11"
title: "Welcome to the Signalen news"
lang: en
template: default
```

For more information on how multilingual support is implemented refer to the section 'Localization'

## Localization
This site has basic multilingual support using the gatsby-plugin-i18n.
It is implemented by the guidelines written in this blogpost:
https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2020-02-19-how-to-build-multilingual-sites-with-gatsby/

You can start your won translation by prefixing the extensions of files which serve up pages by using the ISO country codes. Files which do not include such a prefix will be defaulted to the language as configured in the `gatbsy-config.js` file.

```
example:
index.en.js serves the English equivalent of that page.
```
The plugin makes all the language specific files available under the site-root/<language code> so in the case of English site-root/en/.

### Navigation menu
The navigation menu uses a a key-value list to translate the separate navigation items. The `pages/menu.json` file
contains all the items and translations. To add a new language simply copy another language array, insert the language code and make the language specific translations.

```
"nl": [
  {
    "title": "Over Signalen",
    "link": "/#over-signalen",
    "partiallyActive": false
  },
```
The footer part of the website is generated using the values listed in the `menu.json` file.

### Imported pages do not automatically resolve to language specific versions

Imports in pages need to be referenced explicitly and do not resolve automatically.

For example `import Payoff from '../components/Payoff/` will always resolve to `import Payoff from '../components/Payoff/index.js`. So if you need to reference a language specific version you should indicate the filename `import Payoff from '../components/Payoff/index.en.js`.

In order to add a translation refer to all English related files and make a copy of them including the new language code. Check the `import` statements in the page to check whether they point to the correct translated version of that file.

In the current configuration only the Payoff component and the road map page and component needs to be translated in this fashion.
